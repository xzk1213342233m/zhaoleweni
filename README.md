# py-sec-xbrl
SEC Edgar Parser based on Python 3

The repository is forked from https://github.com/tooksoi/ScraXBRL but I've decided to focus on the parsing part in this repository to simplify stuff, as it varies a lot as to how you want to do the scrapping and it's relatively easier.

Thus 2 priorities for the moment:
1. Simplify scripts to parse SEC XBRL xml files
2. Make the scripts ready as a library that can be installed
